# Photogrtaphic_Objects

This is my Photographic Objets Project it is inspired by the
Art-Book with the same Title. In this Project the Photographic
Process is discused. I have written a little Set of Applications
starting from Sinusidal Study from which are one Iterrations over
the X Axis to another with Parametric Approach. Other Programs
are a Play with Bezier Curves painted Accross the Canvas. Or a
little Set of Plays with the Design of Text.
All this Approachs have it common Points that they are different
Understanding of the Object of Photography. Who here the term
Photography is extended to each Technique of Ploting of Functions
too. So we are discussed here the Principle of making Plots
from abstract Data. This Process is in this Book better explained.
